## 👋 Hey there!

I'm Alex, a full-stack web wizard 🧙‍♂️ who loves turning ideas into responsive, scalable, and beautiful web applications. My toolkit? JavaScript, React, Node.js, and a whole bunch of other tools that make the web tick.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably geeking out over the latest tech trends or planning my next big project.

I’m all about collaboration and building awesome things together. If you’re working on something cool and think we could create something amazing, let’s connect and make it happen! 🚀

Let’s code something epic!
